  Caution: Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is not enabled
Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration configures your server and Internet Explorer in a way that decreases the exposure of your server to potential attacks through Web content and application scripts. This is done by raising the default security levels on Internet Explorer security zones and changing the default settings.

Keeping the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration enabled on your servers is recommended to help ensure that your servers are not inadvertently exposed to malware or other browser-based attacks. For more information, including the complete list of changes that are implemented by Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration, see the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration overview.
